Use computer vision graph cut method to trace materials boundaries in images of liquids and solids materials in transparent vessels.
Receive image of a transparent vessel containing some material and the boundary of the
vessel in the image and return the boundary of the material in the vessel.
This code uses the graph-cut min-cut max flow algorithm to trace boundary of materials in
transparent vessel. Based on the paper: Tracing liquid level and material boundaries in
transparent vessels using the graph cut computer vision approach.
